> The NEW Neural Prophet arrives to R!

```
# Install Development Version 
remotes::install_github("AlbertoAlmuinha/neuralprophet")
```

Not on CRAN yet:

```{r}
#install.packages("neuralprophet")
```



## Neural Prophet Algorithm

Using `neural_prophet()`, which connects to `Python NeuralProphet()`.

```{r example, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(neuralprophet)
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
library(timetk)

m <- m4_monthly %>% filter(id == "M750")

splits <- initial_time_split(m)


model_fit_nprophet <- neural_prophet(
    freq            = "M",
    growth          = "linear",
    trend_reg       = 3,
    learn_rate      = 0.1,
    changepoint_range = 0.8,
    seasonality_mode = "additive"
) %>%
    set_engine("prophet") %>%
    fit(value ~ ., training(splits))

# Forecast with 95% Confidence Interval
modeltime_table(
    model_fit_nprophet
) %>%
    modeltime_calibrate(new_data = testing(splits)) %>%
    modeltime_forecast(
        new_data      = testing(splits),
        actual_data   = m,
        conf_interval = 0.95
    ) %>%
    plot_modeltime_forecast(.interactive = FALSE)
```

## Installation

There are 2 key components to installing neuralprophet:

1. Download the R-Package, `neuralprophet`. This installs the R-Bindings, which allows you to interface with NeuralProphet 

2. Set up the Python Environment so `neuralprophet` can connect to the `neuralprophet` python package. 

### Step 1 - Download & Install neuralprophet

Download the latest development version.  

``` r
remotes::install_github("AlbertoAlmuinha/neuralprophet")
```

### Step 2 - Python Environment Setup

Next, you'll need to set up a Python Environment that contains at a minimum: 

- `neuralprophet==0.2.7`
- `pillow==8.3.0`
- `pandas==1.2.5`
- `numpy`
- `pytorch==1.6`

The python environment then needs to be activated with `reticulate`.

__Fast Setup__

You can use `install_nprophet()` to prepare and bind to a python environment containing `neuralprophet` and the required python packages. 

- You only need to run this one time, and then you are good to go. 
- Each time you load `neuralprophet`, the package will include this environment in it's search process. 


```{r, eval=F}
# Neural Prophet Installation - Run 1st time
install_nprophet()
```

### Step 3 - Restart R and Try an Example

Restart your R session (if in RStudio, close and re-open). Then try this example. 

```{r, eval=F}
library(neuralprophet)
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
library(timetk)

m <- m4_monthly %>% filter(id == "M750")

splits <- initial_time_split(m)


model_fit_nprophet <- neural_prophet(
    freq            = "M",
    growth          = "linear",
    trend_reg       = 3,
    learn_rate      = 0.1,
    changepoint_range = 0.8,
    seasonality_mode = "additive"
) %>%
    set_engine("prophet") %>%
    fit(value ~ ., training(splits))

# Forecast with 95% Confidence Interval
modeltime_table(
    model_fit_nprophet
) %>%
    modeltime_calibrate(new_data = testing(splits)) %>%
    modeltime_forecast(
        new_data      = testing(splits),
        actual_data   = m,
        conf_interval = 0.95
    ) %>%
    plot_modeltime_forecast(.interactive = FALSE)
```


## Troubleshooting Installation

Python Environment setup is always fun. Here are a few recommendations if you run into an issue.

- __Check to make sure Conda or Miniconda is available__ using `reticulate::conda_version()`. If no conda version is returned, then use `reticulate::install_miniconda()` to install Miniconda (recommended vs full Aniconda). Then (re-)run `install_gluonts()`. 

- __Check if Neural Prophet (Python) is available__ using `reticulate::py_module_available("neuralprophet")`. If this returns `TRUE`, then your installation has succeeded in building the environment, but you may have other issues like missing C++ build tools (next).

- __Windows 10 error: Microsoft Visual C++ is required.__ [Here are the instructions for installing the C++ tools needed.](https://github.com/business-science/modeltime.gluonts/issues/4) 

- __Other installation issues.__ [Please file a GitHub issue here.](https://github.com/AlbertoAlmuinha/neuralprophet/issues)
